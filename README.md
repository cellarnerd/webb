# James Webb telescope display
My James Webb telescope display.

There's a video showing how I built it: https://youtu.be/9QwxIP4gGE8

Currently, this is only an HTML file and these instructions. Oh, and the startup file for the Pi. In the future there will be an automation here, so if you decide to build your own â€“ come back after the telescope has been adjusted and has started publishing proper images.
